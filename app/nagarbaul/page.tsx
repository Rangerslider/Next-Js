        Nagar Baul started in 1977 and was originally named Feelings and was
        formed by Kumar Bishwajit. Band members included Ayub Bachchu and
        James.[9] Ayub Bachchu left the band in 1980.[9] They released their
        first album, Station Road.[10] James, lead vocal and guitarist,composed
        all the tracks, and wrote the lyrics for five of them. Though the album
        was not a hit, the tracks Ager Jonome, Amai Jete Dao and Rupshagor
        enjoyed moderate success. In 1993, they released their second album Jail
        Theke Bolchhi. This album was a major hit, and Feelings became a
        mainstream band.[12] In 1998, they released their fourth album Lais Fita
        Lais. In 1999, the band was renamed from Feelings to Nagar Baul. In
        2001, their fifth album was released Dushtur Cheler Dol. This was their
        first album release under the new band name Nagar Baul, named after
        their album from 1996.
